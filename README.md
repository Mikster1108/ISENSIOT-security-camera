# This is the repository for the ISENSIOT security camera project

In this repository you will find all the C programs responsible for managing the sensors that will be used for the security camera. There are also some other things here like scripts for sending data to the database. 

## Running c programs

To run a C program you need to convert it to an .exe file. With gcc you can make a .exe file using ```gcc main.c -o main.exe```
